# Best Data Analytics / Data Science / Machine Learning Blogs to Follow 

This repository is  a personal curated list of the top DA/DS/ML blogs that I find helpful to aspiring data analysts and data scientists. 

As an aspiring data analyst or data scientist just like me, you're probably already aware of the importance of staying current on industry trends and insights. With so much information available out there, it can be very challenging to know where to begin, especially since our time is limited. This is where following blogs can be highly beneficial. I believe that bookmarking or subscribing to the top machine learning blogs to gain access to expert insights and best practices can help you speed up your learning and stay ahead of the curve.
